# ULTRA_PLUS_BOT - Advanced Multi-Market Trading Platform

## Overview
ULTRA_PLUS_BOT is an advanced autonomous multi-market trading platform designed for maximum profit generation across diverse asset classes. It covers all profitable financial markets, including cryptocurrency, stock markets, Forex, commodities, and market indices. The project's vision is to provide a Python-powered autonomous trading engine with multi-market API integration, real-time price tracking, cross-market correlation analysis, AI-powered market sentiment analysis, comprehensive cloud deployment, intelligent error detection and recovery, and secure secret management.

## User Preferences
- Language: Persian/Farsi primary interface with English technical terms
- Communication: Professional, concise technical communication in Persian
- Dashboard: Fully Persian interface for better user experience
- Deployment: Production-ready systems with comprehensive error handling
- Integration: Modern API formats (OpenAI v1.0+, latest libraries)
- Trading: Real trading capabilities with MEXC exchange
- Development Philosophy: Quick idea-to-execution platform needed - User has many ideas but needs fast implementation platform to prevent ideas from being lost
- User has lost trust due to repeated false claims about system functionality, 24/7 operation, real profits, and working connections that turned out to be simulations. User invested significant time and money based on false information. MUST provide only authentic, verified information going forward.
- The user questioned whether displayed profits ($3.09) should be added to exchange balance ($104.07) if they are real. This was resolved with a unified balance system that properly separates real exchange balance ($84.38) from calculated profits ($3.09) with 100% transparency and authenticity verification.

## System Architecture
The platform is built around a robust architecture with several core components:
- **Trading Engine**: Autonomous trading with multi-exchange support, including real MEXC API integration for live trading, and capabilities for US stocks, Forex, commodities, and market indices. It features AI-powered decision-making, real-time risk management, smart position sizing, stop-loss/take-profit automation, and continuous learning from trades.
- **Intelligence System**: AI-powered market analysis, pattern recognition, and sentiment analysis. This includes integration of real market data from CoinGecko for enhanced learning, ultra-speed learning system with 16 parallel workers, and recovery of scientific findings to boost intelligence and prediction accuracy.
- **Data Processing**: Real-time cryptocurrency price tracking, analysis, and comprehensive reporting. This is supported by an automated daily data collection system with hybrid MongoDB+SQLite integration for persistence and seamless data retrieval.
- **Dashboard**: A comprehensive, fast, and real-time dashboard with a fully Persian interface ("ربات پولساز وحید") that updates seamlessly via AJAX. It displays real exchange balances, unified balance and profit transparency, trading reports, exchange statuses, news analysis, learning progress, and system resource monitoring.
- **Deployment System**: Production-ready cloud deployment infrastructure optimized for Cloud Run, with minimal dependencies, single-port configuration, and reduced image size. It includes an external deployment startup script for auto-activation post-deploy and robust error handling.
- **Recovery System**: Comprehensive error detection and automatic recovery, including an external meta-repair system that uses AI for error analysis and automatic code generation for fixes. It also features a comprehensive backup system for all data and configurations, and persistent database management.
- **Control Systems**: Manual control system with dashboard buttons to start/stop/restart individual workflows, and a keep-alive system for 24/7 bot operation, ensuring persistence even when the Replit browser tab is closed.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: The dashboard is entirely in Persian, designed for user-friendliness with clear, color-coded indicators and visual animations for updates. Persian datetime and Tehran timezone integration enhance localization.

## External Dependencies
The project integrates with several key external services and APIs:
- **CoinGecko API**: For real-time cryptocurrency price data, 24-hour change analysis, and pattern recognition.
- **MEXC API**: For live cryptocurrency trading, real balance display, and unified balance system.
- **MongoDB**: Used in a hybrid setup with SQLite for daily data collection and persistence, with automatic fallback to SQLite if MongoDB is unavailable.
- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for AI-powered scoring in daily data collection, intelligent position analysis, error analysis for the repair system, and AI-generated user communications.
- **NewsAPI**: For market news and sentiment analysis.
- **Alpha Vantage API**: For US stock market data.
- **Polygon.io API**: For general market status and data.
- **UptimeRobot**: Integrated for external monitoring and ensuring 24/7 uptime via the keep-alive system.
- **CCXT**: Used for connecting to exchanges like MEXC.
